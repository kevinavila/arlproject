ARL project notes


how to give correct priviledges to the respective user?
following is dependant on user status (regular, standard, admin)
Use authorization scheme (created using SQL)?




---------notification list page---------

when new list is created:
-status has to be set automatically to active
-automatically set the creation date and status effective date to the current system date
-ownership division code should default to the userâ€™s division, but can be overwritten
-if a user changes the status, status_effective_date must be set to current date

list maintenance can be taken care of here


---------employee page--------------


add employees/delete employees (seperate from )


--------membership page---------------

maintain membership of a list. When page is opened, maybe have option to choose list?
once list is chosen, you can remove and add employees to lists and have various search features (look at Maintain Individual List Membership section in project documentation)

--------general maintanence page---------------

Clone all current membership from one employee (either an Active or Inactive employee) to another employee (Active employee only)

Remove a specific employee (Active or Inactive) from all mailing lists that they currently belong to

View membership such that the user can see all lists that a given employee currently belongs to.


--------document page-----------------

apex user can upload and download documents.
