For this homework assignment we decided to add html5 video, as well as a "Download" button to each page where a table is shown to export
the data as a csv file.


Here are the steps to embed html5 video:
   -- On the home page, create a region and select Static Content
   -- The modal will popup
      1. Change the Title and leave everything else as default and click next
      2. On the second page, where it says "Enter Region Source", that is where you will include an ifram link to embed youtube videos
      3. Click next and make sure the Output is HTML
      4. Click Finish


Here are the steps to create a "Download" button to export:
   -- Look at the button section and create a new button
   -- The modal will popup
      1. Create a button name
      2. Fill in the text label - this is the display label on the webapp
      3. Assign a static id - this is the ID for javascript selector
      4. Click Finish
      5. Now create a Dynamic Region
      6. Give it a name
      7. Make sure "Event" is Click, "Selection Type" is Button, and "Button" is the button you created for that page
      8. Make the Dynamic Region Execute Javascript
      9. Include this javascript
              $(document).ready(function() {
  
                    var pID = $v('pFlowId');
                    var pStepId = $v('pFlowStepId');
                    var pIn = $v('pInstance');
                    var url = 'http://apexea.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=' + pID + ':' + pStepId + ':' + pIn + ':CSV:';

                    window.open(url, "_blank");

                    console.log(url);

                });
      10. Click Finish
