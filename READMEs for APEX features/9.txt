Below are the SQL scripts we used to create our views:


CREATE OR REPLACE FORCE VIEW "SIM_DEPT_BUDGET" ("Dept. Name", "Number of Projects", "Number of Managers", "Number of Employees", "Dept. Cost") AS 
  SELECT dept.NAME as "Dept. Name", COUNT(project.PROJECT_ID) as "Number of Projects",
    COUNT(DISTINCT mgr.PERSON_ID) as "Number of Managers",
    COUNT(DISTINCT person.PERSON_ID) as "Number of Employees", SUM(mgr.SALARY)+SUM(person.SALARY) as "Dept. Cost"
FROM SIM_DEPT dept left outer join SIM_PROJECT project on (project.SIM_DEPT_DEPT_ID = dept.DEPT_ID)
    join SIM_MANAGER mgr on (mgr.PERSON_ID = dept.SIM_PERSON_PERSON_ID)
    join SIM_PERSON person on (person.SIM_DEPT_DEPT_ID = dept.DEPT_ID)
GROUP BY dept.NAME
;


CREATE OR REPLACE FORCE VIEW "SIM_PROJECT_BUDGET" ("Project Name", "Number of Employees", "Project Cost") AS 
  SELECT project.NAME as "Project Name", COUNT(pp.PER_PROJ) as "Number of Employees", SUM(person.SALARY) as "Project Cost"
